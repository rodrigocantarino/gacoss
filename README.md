# Project GACOSS - Goofin Around Coding Silly Stuff 

The idea of this repository is to be a study portfolio of the most important things I worked with and some code challenges I had over the years.

On this repository I'll code "my own" framework, as simple as possible, using the most popular design patterns.

Initially the software architecture pattern will be MVC. As the code evolves, new patterns will be added such as Microservices.

- At the beginning the code will use: 
- - PHP (GACOSS Framework);
- - MySQL database;
- - Javascript (Jquery);
- - HTML5 and CSS (Bootstrap 4). 

- As the code evolves, new features will be added, such as: 
- Javascripts Frameworks:
- - React;
- - Angular;
- - Vue; 
- - and so on;
- Languages:
- - Pyton
- Databases:
- - MongoDB 
- - Redis

# Initial Patterns used by GACOSS:
- Autoload
- Design Patterns
- - Singleton Pattern
- - Abstract Factory
- - Factory
- - Interfaces
- - Dependency injections
- Software architecture pattern
- - MVC
